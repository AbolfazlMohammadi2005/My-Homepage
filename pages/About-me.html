        Hi everyone
        <br>
       My name is Abolfazl Mohammadi Yaychi.
       <br>
       As my last name suggests, I`m originally from the village of Yaychi in Ardabil, a mountainous region with a very cold climate. The weather there becomes quite chilly from mid-summer, and sometimes it even snows.
       <br>
I`m an avid reader with a strong passion for physics and mathematics. In physics, I am particularly interested in cosmology, gravitation, and theoretical studies rather than experimental work.
   <br>
Among my artistic interests, I enjoy watching movies and listening to music,and playing the guitar. Since I tend to seek meaning in life, I prefer films and music that are thoughtful and meaningful.
      <br>
      Although I`m generally not fond of fantasy, Peter Jackson's Three-film adaptation of The Lord of the Rings is among the most beautiful movies I have ever seen
